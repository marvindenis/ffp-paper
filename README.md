This repository includes the main script, functions and databases needed to replicate the results and figures of our application of Meucci (2010)'s Fully Flexible Probabilities to portfolio optimisation.

Please note that parts of this code were inspired from the MathWorks Central File Exchange and in particular MATLAB scripts from Attilio Meucci. We were also inspired by the material of Professor Carlo A. Favero’s class "The Econometrics of Asset Allocation and Risk Measurement" available on Bocconi University’s website.
